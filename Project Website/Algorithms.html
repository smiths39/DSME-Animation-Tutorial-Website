					<h2>What is an Algorithm?</h2>
					<p>
						An algorithm is a set of instructions that a computer follows in order to accomplish a specific task required. 
						These tasks can include sorting a set of numbers or finding the greater common denominator of two numbers. 
					</p>
				</section>

				<section role = "Content part 2" id = "middle">
				
					<h2>Problem Areas</h2>
					<p>
						In our experience, and from research carried out by us, we find that Quicksort is regarded as the most essential algorithm to understand as it is often implemented upon a majority of applications.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						We have put a major focus on Quicksort, and other problem areas, to ensure that understanding its functionality is as painless as possible.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						You can read our full tutorial on Quicksort <a href = "Quick_Sort.html"><b>here</b></a>. 
						It includes diagrams, pseudocode and interactive animations which will give you an advance interpretation on how it performs. 
						Also, be sure to watch a <a href = "Screencasts.html"><b>screencast</b></a> on Quicksort, which includes how you would approach implementing it in a Java program.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						We believe it is important that you don't dive into the deep end first, make sure you're comfortable with the most common algorithms before expanding your research on more complex algorithms. 
						See the Approach section below to find out the best way to tackle learning them.

					<h2>Approach</h2>
					<p>
						As previously stated, it's important not to dive into the deep end first. 
						Take your time mastering each algorithm before you move on.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Firstly, start off with Bubble Sort and understand its use and implementation. 
					</p>
					
					<p>
						It is best to start off with this algorithm as its implementation is relatively easy. 
					</p>
					
					<p>
						After you're comfortable with how Bubble Sort works and if you can personally implement it, then progress to other common algorithms, such as Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort and Heap Sort. 
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Lastly, move on to Quicksort. As it is considered to be the most common algorithm to implement, due its optimal complexity rate. 
						It is important that you have a good understanding of these algorithms as they frequently arise as the best candidates to implement within certain applications.
