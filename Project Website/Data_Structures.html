						<h2>What is a Data Structure?</h2>
					</hgroup>	
					
					<p>
						In its most simple form, a data structure stores and organises data. 
						Each data structure, be it a Stack or a Queue, can be used for a specific purpose and be accessed in an appropriate way.
					</p>
				</section>
				
				<section id="middle">
				
					<h2>Problem Areas</h2>
					<p>
						In our experience, and from research carried out by us, we find that Doubly Linked Lists and Binary Search Trees are generally found difficult by students learning Data Structures and Algorithms.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						It is important to understand Binary Search Trees in particular as they are highly efficient in adding and removing data. 
						We have put a major focus on this specific data structure, and other problem areas, to ensure that understanding its functionality is as painless as possible.
					</p> 
					
					<p>
						You can read our full tutorial on Binary Search Trees <a href = "Binary_Tree.html"><b>here</b></a>.
						It includes diagrams, pseudocode and interactive animations which will give you a greater idea at how they perform.</a> 
						Also, be sure to watch a <a href = "Screencasts.html"><b>screencast</b></a> on Binary Search Trees, which includes how you would approach implementing it in a Java program.
					</p>

					<p>
						We believe it is important that you don't dive into the deep end first, make sure you're comfortable with other less difficult data structures before you learn how more advanced data structures, such as Binary Search Trees, work. 
						See the Approach section below to find out the best way to tackle learning them.</p>

					<h2>Approach</h2>
					
					<p>
						As previously stated, it's important not to dive into the deep end first. Take your time mastering each data structure before you move on.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Firstly, learn how <a href = "Stack.html"><b>Stacks</b></a> (Bounded and Unbounded) and <a href = "Queue.html"><b>Queues</b></a> (Bounded and Unbounded) operate.
					</p> 
					
					<p>
						After you're comfortable with Stacks and Queues, advance to Linked Lists. 
						We have sections on Singly Linked Lists and Doubly Linked Lists <a href = "Linked_List.html"><b>here</b></a>.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Lastly, move on to <a href = "Binary_Tree.html"><b>Binary Search Trees.</b></a> As they are considered quite difficult, it is important that you have a good understanding of other common data structures before moving onto them.
